Executive Summary:
  
  An explosion of clinical trials occured to help prevent spread, and develop vaccines for the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic. Given Covid-19's current impact, our team decided to analyze the publicaly available trial data to better understand the relationship between number of trials by year, country, specific trial site, symptoms(s), and sponsor. In addition, our team also analyzed trial enrollment numbers, target age, and gender data among trial subjects. Our team obtained information from the ClinicalTrials.gov API in July 2020, cleaned the dataset, and began developing afore-mentioned relationships. The major findings were:
  
  - Clinical trials though broad in scope tended to focus more on the respiratory symptoms of Covid-19
  - Number of trials exploded 700x in 2020, and majority of them occured in developed nations, and run very frequently by independent    organizations in collaboration with one another
  - Trials focused on elderly patients with <100 participants in majority of the trials
 
  Note the world is in constant flux due to the evolving nature of Covid-19 and further R&D (lab and/or clinical trial data), public policies, and other relevant information might come to light that alter the nature of future clinical trials. As a result, these reported findings are to be treated just as a snapshot in time.
